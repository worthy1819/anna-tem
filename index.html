        <button class="accordion">What is kombucha?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>​Kombucha is a probiotic drink made from naturally fermenting tea, sugar, and a culture of bacteria and
                yeast (SCOBY). It is also known by its folk name of tea fungus or kombucha mushroom, but it's important
                to clarify that the "mushroom" is actually a symbiotic culture and not a forest mushroom. This ancient
                and natural drink has gained worldwide popularity due to its unique taste and health benefits.
                <br><br>
                Today, our kombucha combines authenticity with modern quality and precision, bringing together the best
                of flavor and health benefits.

        <button class="accordion">Alive VS pasteurized kombucha</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Alive or raw kombucha refers to a that in which all the active bacteria remain "alive."
                <br><br>
                Unlike most pasteurized drinks on the shelves, live drinks are less shelf stable, should be
                refrigerated, and have a shorter shelf life.

                <br><br>
                However, every sip provides a generous dose of live bacteria that benefit digestive health and
                strengthen the immune system. We believe in the importance of live foods, especially in a world where
                almost all the foods are pasteurized (dead). Therefore, we commit to never pasteurize our kombucha,
                despite the logistical challenges and costs involved.

        <button class="accordion">What drives us?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Have you ever finished a yoga class, workout, or practice and then gone to a restaurant, café, or a drink
                store, only to find that nothing on the shelf matches your vibe? Or that there's nothing you feel truly
                comfortable giving your kids to drink?

                <br><br>
                Maybe you don't even try because you've been disappointed before and realized there's nothing to drink
                outside the house, at best a fresh juice which is usually from concentrate...
                <br><br>
                This happened to us often, and we realized this is not the world we want. Therefore, we aim to create
                drinks that support healthy and conscious living.

        <button class="accordion">Probiotic Pill vs kombucha</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Is it the same to ingest a probiotic pill or to drink alive kombucha?
                <br><br>
                We often hear this question.
                <br><br>

                And the answer is- no. It is not the same.
                <br><br>
                The main points to be aware off are the following:
                <br><br>
                1/ de-activating or freeze-drying the probiotic culture to create a pill.
                <br>
                2/ survival rate of the probiotics in the digestive system.
            </p>

        <button class="accordion">100% kombucha VS kombucha soda</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>100% kombucha is a naturally fermented drink with health benefits from probiotics, anti-oxydants,
                vitamins, and minerals. It goes through a natural fermentation cycle and is bottled at the peak of
                aliveness, when the probiotic content is at its highest.

                <br><br>
                In contrast, kombucha soda uses an over fermented kombucha, which culture has decreased and is referred
                to as an acidifier. Its taste is strong and vinegar-like. Part of this acidifier kombucha becomes an
                ingredient along with water, sweeteners, artificial or natural flavorings and CO2. Result is a quite
                stable product, with none or minimal living probiotic content.
            </p>

        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Heatlhy Gut. Healthy Body</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>​A healthy gut is the foundation for overall good health. The gut contains billions of beneficial
                bacteria that aid digestion, absorb nutrients, and strengthen the immune system, and much more.

                <br><br>
                A diet rich in fiber, probiotics, and adequate hydration is essential for maintaining a healthy gut.
                Symptoms like bloating, gas, and fatigue can indicate poor digestive function.
                <br><br>
                Incorporating fermented foods like kombucha, yogurt, and sauerkraut can help maintain the balance of gut
                bacteria and improve overall health.
            </p>

        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Who is it for? &how much?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>​Our product can be found in health food stores, cafes, restaurants, and bars.
                <br><br>
                It is suitable for both children and adults, with the only exception being for those who avoid acidic or
                unpasteurized products.

                <br><br>
                The recommended amount varies from person to person, as we all differ in size and structure, and of
                course, in our eating habits and microbiome.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, the right amount can range anywhere between a small shot glass to a few bottles of kombucha
                throughout the day. We always recommend listening to your own body and in the case of special health
                conditions - always consult your healthcare provider.

        <button class="accordion">No Caffeine in our kombucha</button>
        <!-- upper text is question  -->
        <div class="panel">
            <p>​Although the base is tea that naturally contains caffeine, during fermentation, kombucha breaks down not
                only the sugars but also the caffeine in the tea. This results in a refreshing, invigorating drink that
                is also caffeine-free.

                <br><br>
                We found it out during a session of lab tests that we did, not even expecting this result… Yet another
                one of the kombucha’s wonders!
