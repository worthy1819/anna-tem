                <button class="accordion">What is kombucha?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>​Kombucha is a probiotic drink made from naturally fermenting tea, sugar, and a culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). It is also known by its folk name of tea fungus or kombucha mushroom, but it's important to clarify that the "mushroom" is actually  a symbiotic culture and not a forest mushroom. This ancient and natural drink has gained worldwide popularity due to its unique taste and health benefits. 
                        <br><br>
                    Today, our kombucha combines authenticity with modern quality and precision, bringing together the best of flavor and health benefits.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Alive VS pasteurized kombucha</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Alive or raw kombucha refers to a that in which all the active bacteria remain "alive."
                        <br><br>
                        Unlike most pasteurized drinks on the shelves, live drinks are less shelf stable, should be refrigerated, and have a shorter shelf life. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        However, every sip provides a generous dose of live bacteria that benefit digestive health and strengthen the immune system. We believe in the importance of live foods, especially in a world where almost all the foods are pasteurized (dead). Therefore, we commit to never pasteurize our kombucha, despite the logistical challenges and costs involved.</p>

                <button class="accordion">What drives us?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Have you ever finished a yoga class, workout, or practice and then gone to a restaurant, café, or a drink store, only to find that nothing on the shelf matches your vibe? Or that there's nothing you feel truly comfortable giving your kids to drink?
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Maybe you don't even try because you've been disappointed before and realized there's nothing to drink outside the house, at best a fresh juice which is usually from concentrate...
                        <br><br>
                        This happened to us often, and we realized this is not the world we want. Therefore, we aim to create drinks that support healthy and conscious living.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Probiotic Pill vs kombucha</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Is it the same to ingest a probiotic pill or to drink alive kombucha? 
                        <br><br>
                        We often hear this question. 
                        <br><br>
                        
                        And the answer is- no. It is not the same.
                        <br><br>
                        The main points to be aware off are the following: 
                        <br><br>
                        1/ de-activating or freeze-drying the probiotic culture to create a pill.
                        <br>
                        2/  survival rate of the probiotics in the digestive system.</p>

                <button class="accordion">100% kombucha VS kombucha soda</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>100% kombucha is a naturally fermented drink with health benefits from probiotics, anti-oxydants, vitamins, and minerals. It goes through a natural fermentation cycle and is bottled at the peak of aliveness, when the probiotic content is at its highest. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        In contrast, kombucha soda uses an over fermented kombucha, which culture has decreased and is referred to as an acidifier. Its taste is strong and vinegar-like. Part of this acidifier kombucha becomes an ingredient along with water, sweeteners,  artificial or natural flavorings and CO2. Result is a quite stable product, with none or minimal living probiotic content.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>​A healthy gut is the foundation for overall good health. The gut contains billions of beneficial bacteria that aid digestion, absorb nutrients, and strengthen the immune system, and much more.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        A diet rich in fiber, probiotics, and adequate hydration is essential for maintaining a healthy gut. Symptoms like bloating, gas, and fatigue can indicate poor digestive function. 
                        <br><br>
                        Incorporating fermented foods like kombucha, yogurt, and sauerkraut can help maintain the balance of gut bacteria and improve overall health.</p>
                        
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Who is it for? &how much?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>​Our product can be found in health food stores, cafes, restaurants, and bars.
                        <br><br>
                        It is suitable for both children and adults, with the only exception being for those who avoid acidic or unpasteurized products.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        The recommended amount varies from person to person, as we all differ in size and structure, and of course, in our eating habits and microbiome. 
                        <br><br>
                        Therefore, the right amount can range anywhere between a small shot glass to a few bottles of kombucha throughout the day. We always recommend listening to your own body and in the case of special health conditions - always consult your healthcare provider.</p>

                <button class="accordion">No Caffeine in our kombucha</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>​Although the base is tea that naturally contains caffeine, during fermentation, kombucha breaks down not only the sugars but also the caffeine in the tea. This results in a refreshing, invigorating drink that is also caffeine-free.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        We found it out during a session of lab tests that we did, not even expecting this result… Yet another one of the kombucha’s wonders!</p>
